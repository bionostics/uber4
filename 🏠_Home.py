# st.write("According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases are the single top cause of mortality worldwide, responsible for 17.9 million deaths each year ‚Äî which translates into 32% of all global deaths. Simultaneously, common diseases like the Lung Cancer and Diabetes (which are both experiencing a drastic increase in global cases following the COVID-19 pandemic) accounts for long-term health hindrances that are often untreatable, and yields frequent hospital visits for patients carrying the disease. \
# Bionostics aims to reduce these chilling statistics, not through medical advancements, but through creating an easy-to-use and accurate diagnostic app for common diseases made even more contemporary by the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the possibilities that this initiative can bring to life is enormous, and is backed by scientific research. As WHO postulated in its Newsroom Q&A, 80% of premature heart attacks are preventable, of which early and personalized detection of the high likelihood for one to contract the disease can make space for quicker action to be taken, ultimately saving precious time for the patient. With Bionostics‚Äôs precise diagnosis being just a hand reach away, our service can alert users in time to seek medical treatments, and reduce the number of global lives lost to our common enemies.")

After hours of backfiring ideas, we finally discovered an idea that we both had a passion to pursue. We discovered the bridge between machine learning and medicine.")
